+++

Hey there! I wanted to share how I approach writing these posts—think of it as my little style guide that keeps me consistent and hopefully makes these more enjoyable for you to read.

I've learned over years of consulting that the best insights come from real experiences, not theoretical frameworks. So everything I write here comes from actual projects, conversations with clients, or those "aha" moments that happen when you're deep in the design trenches. I try to keep things conversational, like we're chatting over coffee about the latest design challenge.

You'll notice I don't use headers or fancy formatting within posts. It's intentional—I want each piece to flow like a natural conversation. The first paragraph always gives you the gist of what we're diving into, so you can decide if it's worth your time right from the home page.

I keep the jargon to a minimum because, honestly, our industry has enough of that already. When I do use UX terminology, I try to explain it in a way that makes sense to anyone building digital products, whether you're a designer, developer, or product manager.

My goal is to share practical insights that you can actually use in your work tomorrow. These aren't academic theories—they're battle-tested approaches from real client engagements and personal projects. Hope you find them helpful!
